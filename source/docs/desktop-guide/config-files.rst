Plasma Configuration Files
===========================

This section goes over common configuration files that store Plasma settings such as theme, panels (and their positions), widgets (and their positions) and keyboard shortcuts. This path ~/ means it is in your home folder so the full path would be /home/aaronh/.

* ~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc

  * This stores shortcuts such as switching desktops, media keys, launching applications like System Monitor and Dolphon.

* ~/.config/krunner

  * This stores KRunners behavior such as if it is floating such as in the center of the screen.

* ~/.config/kwinrc

  * This stores your desktops (including their names), Meta (Super Key, Windows Key or Command Key) action.
