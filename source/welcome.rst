What is Linux?
===============

Linux is an operating system kernel that resembles the Unix operating system. The kernel is the main software required for any operating system, providing a communication bridge between hardware and software. Linux has become a leading element of the worldwide movement to embrace free and open source software. The term "GNU/Linux" is a way of referring to operating systems based on the Linux kernel combined with parts from the `GNU Project <http://www.gnu.org>`_.
