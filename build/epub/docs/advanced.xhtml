<p>This section covers the basics of configuring Kubuntu to suit your needs. One of the strengths of the <em>KDE</em> philosophy is the focus on control of just about every aspect of the desktop environment. Wallpapers, themes, widgets, color schemes, splash screens, and more; the options for customization are endless.</p>
<p>KDE-Look is the number one location to find customized settings for the <em>KDE</em> Plasma desktop. Some of the applications even allow direct connections to KDE-Look to download a new configuration or image.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Activites are specific and exclusive to KDE. As such they’re often under utilised and misunderstood. In this section we’re going to explore what KDE Activities are, how to set them up, and how to use them.</p>
<p>Think for a moment about your average day working on your PC. It will often traverse different activities. For example doing email and researching things on the internet, perhaps developing some documents, working on a piece of software, writing your thesis in LaTeX etc…</p>
<p>Commonly KDE users might use Virtual desktops to seperate these workspaces.</p>
<p>KDE Activites in Kubuntu provide a slick way to setup and configure environments specific to your task routines. For example your might want to have your email, and social networks configured as one activity. Perhaps your research, and writing for your thesis configured as another activity.</p>
</section>
<section id="activities-first-look">
<h2>Activities first look</h2>
<img alt="../_images/activities.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/activities.png" style="width: 881.25px; height: 628.5px;" />
<p>Let’s take a look at the default KDE Activities configured in Kubuntu. Right Click anywhere on the empty desktop and choose “Activities” from the menu. The Activities side bar appears on the left, with the Default activity. Notice the + Create Activity at the bottom. Click that, and lets created a new “Social” Activity.
Enter “Social” as the Activity name: and then click Create.</p>
<p>That’s it you have created your first activity.</p>
<p>You can theme, and configured this new activity desktop in the same ways as mentioned early in this section of the manual.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-step-further">
<h2>A Step Further</h2>
<p>OK, looking good, lets create another Activity. Call this one “Misc”. Once created switch to this Activity, either by Right Click on the Desktop &gt; Activities or use the Keyboard shortcut Alt+D,A ( Hold Alt down, press D, then Press A )
Then select the Misc Activity from the side bar.</p>
<p>OK, lets configure a few useful tools</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Change the desktop wallpaper to something you like</p></li>
<li><p>Right click &gt; Add Widgets, and add the Digital Clock</p></li>
<li><p>Right click &gt; Add Widgets, and add the Comic Strip</p></li>
<li><p>Right click &gt; Add Widgets, and add the Hard Disk Space Usage</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can now resize these widgets and lay them out on the desktop however you wish. and configure them to suit your needs, as in the example below.</p>

<section id="drivers">
<h3>Drivers</h3>
<p>On every Operating System (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) there are programs called Drivers which you install on your computer. These Drivers let your computer use new hardware or existing hardware, like <a class="reference external" href="https://userbase.kde.org/Kubuntu/Basic#Wireless">Wi-Fi</a><span class="link-target"> [https://userbase.kde.org/Kubuntu/Basic#Wireless]</span>. There Drivers also cover your graphics card e.g NVIDIA, AMD, sometimes the nonfree or restricted drivers let the cards perform better than the free ones. The Driver Manager handles installing and uninstalling these for you. These improvements may cover gaming, video editing and processing to image editing.</p>
