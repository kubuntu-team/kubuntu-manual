<h2>Contact and Support</h2>
<p>There are three ways to contact with the Kubuntu Project; mailing lists (email), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and the forums.</p>
<section id="mailing-lists">
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>Mailing lists are the Kubuntu Project’s official communication tools. They allow for email discussion and have searchable archives.</p>
<p>Subscribe:
To begin using the mailing lists, please subscribe. Subscribing allows you to post a message without having it sit in an authorization queue, and allows you to receive messages from others who are also subscribed to the mailing list.</p>
<p>Before you send a message, check to see if the topic has been raised in the past. To do this, use Google to search the archives.</p>
<p>Refer to the Contribute Page for more infomation about Mailing Lists.</p>

<h2>Kubuntu Phone Support</h2>
<p>If you or your organisation needs help with your computer systems running Kubuntu but you don’t want to worry about the best IRC channel to ask in you can pay some money and phone up the office in England to get some help. They will use phone, e-mail, Google hangout, Skype, VNC and any other method you like to help diagnose the issue and resolve it for you.</p>
