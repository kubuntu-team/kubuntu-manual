Contribute
===========

The Kubuntu community is made up of individuals and teams working to package software, test it, triage bugs, and then promote Kubuntu to a wider audience. All of the software, artwork, and documentation has been created, tested, used, and discussed openly by people around the world participating in the Open Source community made possible by the Internet. We invite you to help shape Kubuntu to better meet your needs. 

Spreading the word
-------------------

The easiest way to give back to the Kubuntu community is by sharing Kubuntu with others. Recommend Kubuntu to others, show them how to download and install it, and discuss the possibilities and qualities of Open Source Software with them. As our community grows, it becomes more vigorous and supported. 

Giving support and getting it
------------------------------

Providing support is an awesome way to give back to the community because it is not required to have advanced skills or know everything about Linux or Kubuntu. You'll actually end up learning more as you help others, which increases your own knowledge and skills. This can be a gateway to learning other things, from bug triaging to packaging, and perhaps even to programming. Also, it is quite rewarding to fix the system of someone who is on the other side of the world!

You can give support and get it in the IRC channels, through the `Kubuntu Users Mailing List <https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kubuntu-users>`_, or through the `Kubuntu Forums <https://www.kubuntuforums.net/content.php>`_, `Ubuntu Forums <http://ubuntuforums.org/>`_, and `KDE Forums <https://forum.kde.org/>`_.

Being a Kubuntu tester involves running bleeding-edge software, testing ISO's to see if they install correctly, and testing packages to confirm that a bug is fixed. If you want to help test Kubuntu, see `Kubuntu Testers <https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuTesters>`_.
