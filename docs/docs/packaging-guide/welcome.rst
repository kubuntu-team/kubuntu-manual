The beauty of Open Source is that you are not limited to simply using the software in a predetermined way. You can choose how and what you do with it, and this includes copying and modifying the software that you use.
This guide is designed to get you started on your journey in modifying Kubuntu, changing and contributing to make the software do the things that you want it ti.

This guide takes you on a step by step journey from getting set up with all the tools you need for software packaging. You are highly encouraged to support your exploration with the wider Kubuntu community, by joining the Kubuntu Developers mailing list
