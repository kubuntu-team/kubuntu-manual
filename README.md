## How it works

The documentation is powered by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).

Run the following command to install the needed dependencies:

Bash:

```
sudo apt install python3-sphinx python3-pip texlive-full && pip3 install sphinx_bootstrap_theme
```                                                                                            

Fish:

```
sudo apt install python3-sphinx python3-pip texlive-full; and pip3 install sphinx_bootstrap_theme
```
                                                                                                           
You can see the options for building the documentation by running `make help`.                             

## How translations work

Documentation is here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/intl.html

```
pip3 install sphinx-intl
```

## What you can do

Once you use 'git clone' to copy this repo to your machine you can:

```
make html - to produce HTML files in build/html
```

```
make latexpdf - to produce a PDF file in build/latex
```

```
make epub -- to produce a epub file in build/epub
```

We are aware that the images in the epub are pixely and looking for a fix
                                                                                                           
## Contributing                                                                                            
                                                                                                           
To contribute to the Kubuntu Manual, you can either create a pull request on GitHub, or send patch mail to 
[kubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com](mailto:kubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com) and prefix the subject with `[Kubuntu Manual Pull Request]`.                

We take simple fixes like grammar, spelling, translations, and new pages!

For how we format the pages look at RST-Template.rst as a starting point.
